VGP Garden Fabrics Simplified - https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2007062335

Works for both the Full and Simplified versions VGP Garden Fabrics. Should be loaded after VGP Garden Fabrics.

v0.1.0.0 - Initial release.

v0.1.1.0 - Updated to support RimWorld version 1.3. Added patches for new Bulk recipes added by dismarzero. Included a patch to add a research prerequisite (Synthread Research) for the Plasteel Thread recipe since Plasteel Thread is useless without the Synthread research. This prevents the recipe from cluttering the list when it is not yet useful.

v0.1.2.0 - Updated to support RimWorld version 1.4.

v0.1.3.0 - Updated to support RimWorld version 1.5.
